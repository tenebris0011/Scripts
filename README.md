# Scripts
This folder contains all scripts that I use a lot at work.  
Scripts will be named with what it does, and what the extension needs to be.  
I will be adding scripts as I right them.  
All scripts have been modified with "sample" values, you will need to replace these for the scripts to run.  
If you have any scripts that you see errors in, just comment.
