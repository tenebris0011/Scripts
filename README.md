# Scripts
This folder contains all scripts that I use a lot at work.  
Scripts will be named with what it does, and what the extension needs to be.  
I will be adding scripts as I right them.  
All scripts have been modified with "sample" values, you will need to replace these for the scripts to run.  
If you have any scripts that you see errors in, just submit an issue.  
If you have any suggestions for changes, please submit an issue.  

#Disclaimer
I am not liable for any legal trouble or otherwise that you get in using scripts listed in this repository.  
These are meant for legal use, and legal use alone.
